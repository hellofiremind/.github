# Default community health files

GitHub will use and display default files for any repo in the Firemind org.
These defaults will not get used if a repo has its own .github/ or docs/ folder with templates in them.

The issue and pull request templates here will be automaitcally used when a user raises an issue or creates a PR in any of the Firemind repos.

Default files are not included in clones, packages, or downloads of individual repositories because they are stored only in the .github repository.
